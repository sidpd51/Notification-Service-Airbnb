# üì¢ Airbnb Notification Service

A scalable notification microservice for Airbnb, built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express**, **BullMQ**, and **Redis**. Supports **email** and **SMS** delivery with queue-based job handling, robust validation using **Zod**, centralized error handling, structured logging, and request tracing.

-   üßë‚Äçüíº Admin UI for queue monitoring with **Bull Board**
-   üßµ Request tracing via Correlation IDs
-   üõë Centralized error handling
-   üßæ Structured logging with **Winston**
-   ‚úÖ Payload validation via **Zod**
-   üîå Extensible for additional notification channels (e.g., push)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
-   [Redis](https://redis.io/) (running on port `6379`)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for local Redis)

---

## üê≥ Running Redis via Docker

```bash
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:7
```

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidpd51/Notification-Service-Airbnb.git
cd Notification-Service-Airbnb

npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with appropriate values
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Update the `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=3000
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

EMAIL_FROM=your@email.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password

SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY=your_sms_provider_api_key
```

> Redis connection settings are centralized in `src/config/index.ts`.

## üß† Why a Notification Microservice?

In complex applications like Airbnb, features such as **Auth**, **Bookingn**, and **Payment processing** are handled by different microservices. However, all of them usually need to send notifications ‚Äî whether by email or SMS or may be push notification.

### ‚ùå The Problem

Traditionally, each service would implement its own notification logic:

-   Code duplication: Every service re-implements similar email/SMS logic.
-   Hard to maintain: Changes in template or delivery logic need updates in multiple places.
-   Violates DRY principle: Repeating logic leads to bloated codebases and inconsistent behavior.

### ‚úÖ The Solution

We introduced a **dedicated Notification Microservice** that handles all notification responsibilities:

-   Acts as a **single point of contact** for email and SMS delivery.
-   Accepts HTTP requests from any service with a notification payload.
-   Ensures **clean separation of concerns** ‚Äî services focus on their core logic.

### üöÄ Why Queues?

Notifications don‚Äôt always need to be sent instantly ‚Äî they just need to be **reliably delivered**.

But consider this:

-   If thousands of users register or book at once, handling all notifications synchronously would block your APIs and overload your servers.
-   This is where **asynchronous processing** comes in.

We use **Redis queues via [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/)** to offload notification jobs:

-   Services send a payload to the notification API.
-   The payload is pushed to a Redis queue.
-   A worker picks up jobs from the queue and processes them.
-   The API immediately responds:  
    ‚ûú `"Your notification has been added to the queue and will be sent shortly."`

### üí° Benefits

-   High scalability and fault tolerance.
-   Faster response times for upstream services.
-   Centralized logic for all templates and delivery channels.
-   Easy to monitor and retry failed jobs via **Bull Board**.

With this setup, our notification service can **handle high loads**, **scale independently**, and **keep our main services clean and DRY**.
